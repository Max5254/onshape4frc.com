There's a new way to use the MKCad parts library!
Thanks to a few amazing developers, all Onshape users are now able to access MKCad parts & assemblies through an integrated app.

This is now the recommended method for using the MKCad library - it is easy, convienent, and has a search bar that makes finding parts much quicker.

To get started with the app, subscribe to the <a target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description'>MKCad App on the Onshape App Store</a>.

To learn how to use the app and more, head over to our <a href="/cad-library">MKcad Onshape Library page</a>.
